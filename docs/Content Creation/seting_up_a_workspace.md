# Workspace Setup

It is generally recommended to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for the management of projects. Especially if they are software related. We're using [GitHub](http://github.com/) as our hosting platform, however you are free to use any alternative that you like. GitHub also offers an easy to use client that is really beginner friendly. It is called [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

Once your software is set up, you can create your first repository.Personally I do not like to create my local repository folders inside the garrysmod addons folder since I prefer to have all my projects inside one folder to keep them organised. This creates a problem though, since it is really tedious to copy the contents from addons folder to the projects folder and back. [Symbolic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) are a neat solution for this. Personally on windows I use a graphical interface ([tutorial on setup and use](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/)), however it is up to your own preferences.
